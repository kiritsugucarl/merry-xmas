                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Hi love! Merry Christmas to you and Happy Holidays! Bago mag end ang year at habang pasko, eto na yung wrapped of the year!!! Daming pakulo no? Naisip ko lang to bigla HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA gusto kitang bigyan. May ginawa na akong something similar dito before for you pero it didnt reach you kasi di ako satisfied. Eto medyo satisfied ako, so definitely, makakaabot sayo to.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to tell you that I am very grateful na dumating ka sa buhay ko. You made this year extra special for me, and isa ka sa mga best things that have happened this year. I know naman na alam mo how important and special you are to me, and how much I value you. Second, thank you for your patience, sa mga stupidity ko sa buhay, sa mga nagagawa kong di mo gusto, sa mga nagiging pagkukulang ko, at sa mga nagagawa kong mali. I've been working on those and I hope that im providing results that you can visibly see and I am working on becoming a better man for you.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Then, I express that I am looking forward for the next couple of years with you. I know that I might be too far-sighted with this, pero oo, I can see us in the long road ahead, and I hope you do so too. As the Christmas spirit falls and the New Year starts, I am happy that I will be celebrating these events with you. Looking forward, I wish we continue to love each other along the way and keep tabs on making each other happy. Happy Holidays Love, to you and your family. I love you!
